# Dancing in the Dark

## Chapter 1

The fire splutters as I fan my hand over the coals with an audible crack, its last breath.

A small voice behind me desperately cries, "No, the story wasn't finished!" as I am snapped out of my trance-like storytelling state by the sudden onset of black.

Everything seems different at night. More... sharp. The complicated colours of the daytime are converted into monotones of varying look - some soft, some harsh, but never out-of-place, and the light blue of the day sky morphs into a beautiful display of lights, contrasting beautifully on a dark background.

I've heard stories about the city children - everyone here in Newbor has. I've heard stories about children who have left their houses in the darkness and never returned. I've heard millions of stories about the dangers of the darkness. About how there are a million and one different things which can happen to you if you're outside during the dark. We all have. But we all also know that there is no need to be afraid of the dark in Newbor, where the only strangers are the occasional traveling merchants who visit us once or twice every Solstice, and even then they only stay during the daytime. At night, we have the 50-odd residents of Newbor to protect us, and because of that we need not fear the darkness.

"Please, don't go. I wanna hear another story," Meya pleads, pulling on my arm as if she never wants to let me go. Outwardly, I sigh, while little My lets out an exuberant sigh of relief, relaxing her iron grip on my arm. Slowly, I turn towards her, looking at her sternly in the dim moonlight.

"Fine, but _one more_ story. A short one, too."

She contently slumps down in her bed as I jump under the warm covers, and prepare my richest storytelling voice.

"They say that Newbor is haunted sometimes, by the plague of a devil long gone. A devil so devilish that whatever it touched would turn to ash, so devilish that it could wipe out fields of crops with a single word, so devilish that it could summon a tempest with purely the power of its mind."

Meya shudders with something - either fear of excitement, I can't tell which - before settling back down, to let me finish.

"You see, long ago there was an Alchemist in Newbor, a man who could summon up mythical creatures with just the power of his mind and a few spells. One day the Alchemist got bored with conjuring toads and frogs to entertain the town" - there was a stifle of a laugh from My - "and decided to test his power, to see just what he _could_ summon. So, he flipped open his book, and saw that the previous owner of the book had slipped in a piece of paper with a spell on it."

"Now, being the curious fellow he was this Alchemist was excited to make sense of this spell, so he tried to decipher it to see what it did. And yet, nobody knew exactly what the incantations were, and what they would do. The potions were completely new mixtures, seemingly frivolous but upon closer look rather complex and ingenious. The ingredients were exotic and mysteriously new. The brewing methods were nothing short of difficult. And the Alchemist, sensing a challenge in the spell, decided to undertake it as his new project."

"So, he traveled far and wide in search for the ingredients to make the potions. He asked both the knowledgeable and the experienced Wizards of the world to try to decipher the incantations. He relentlessly researched the potion ingredients, and painstakingly collected a pantry of the materials he would need to complete this spell."

"But, you see, there was a simple reason nobody understood what the spell did - because it wasn't a spell from the mortal realm. Uduootu, from the Cthulhu demon land, had possessed a child in Newbor to slip a sheet of paper into the Alchemist's spell tome, to summon him into the Humans' world. And, like Uduootu had planned, when the spell was summoned, the demon was transported into Newbor, right beside the Alchemist."

"Yet there was a problem. Uduootu had been forced to use a weak, humane spell, which severely limited his power and range to only a fraction of his full capacity, and therefore was not only bound to Newbor, but also incapable of hurting any adults in the town."

"So, Uduootu fed his thirst for blood with the poor children of the town. It wasn't long before Uduootu had snatched the Newbor children from their mothers and sentenced them... to eternal hell within Cthulhu, the worst form of hell!"

My voice raises in both pitch and volume to a shout, filling the room and the nearby fields with a reverent echo which rings for many seconds. Meya gasps, a piercing shriek which stands out against the echo in the silence.

"But the Alchemist was a very talented wizard, capable of great feats of magic, and it was this skill he tested as he tried to return the children to their mournful parents. It took him weeks, months even, but eventually the Alchemist was able to reverse the spell and trade the children for Uduootu, returning the demon to his own realm and also returning the children back to the Human realm."

"Unfortunately, no matter how powerful, the Alchemist was no match for Uduootu. He only held one trump card, which was that to conjure his magic in Roshan the demon would have to have a strong link to the land - something he didn't have."

Meya's relief was palpable as she exhaled deeply, as if she had been holding her breath, and breathed out a barely-audible "phew."

"Except all great men make mistakes and this was true of the Alchemist."

A sheen of sweat broke out on My's forehead, which I wiped away with my bare hand.

"When Uduootu was summoned, he was personified in a demon body, as all demons are upon entering a foreign realm. And, following the orders of god Shatan, the Alchemist made sure to give Uduootu a respectful burial, in the Newbor courtyard, just like he would have given any deceased man or woman."

"And this was Uduootu's link to the mortal realm. _Our_ realm. As his body decomposed, traces of his powers merged with the earth and the air, and centuries after the passing of the Alchemist, Uduootu was able to regain some of his power. So, to continue terrorising the villagers of Newbor, he controlled the air, in gusts, to blow on the villagers and remind them of his constant gaze."

"He controlled the earth, making earthquakes and crop famine,"

"He controlled the water, creating storms and tempests."

"Legend has it that one day, another Alchemist will arise. One so powerful they will be able to challenge Uduootu himself. One so powerful, that they will be able to crush the remains of Uduootu's power surrounding Newbor, and bring an end to the misery he has caused."

By this time, Meya had long fallen asleep.



## Chapter 2

The sound of the shutters slamming shut wakes me up with a sudden jolt.

Meya is already awake, happily sifting through a storybook, murmuring to herself. She notices me sitting up and groaning, and puts down her book to wave at me and say "Good morning."

I slowly get up, trying to make as little sound as possible so I don't disturb Mum or the neighbors, and reach out my hands to close the shutters before -
Hmm. That's weird.
There is a boy standing in the field, a complete stranger, surveying my humble town.
But before I can alert the Council of Elders the boy's eyes lock onto mine, and open wide in surprise. A blink later, he is gone, disappeared from the field, from the horizon. Not even a trail remains, or a dent in the long grass, and I am left wondering: "Did I imagine that?"

For the next five minutes I stare at that field, hypnotized by it, waiting to see the boy again. Either he isn't foolish enough to return, or I was daydreaming again.

Meya notices my unfocused stare and comes over to see what I'm looking at, sticking her head out of the window so that the wind blows on her hair. "There's nothing here! Stop daydreaming and get a move on, lazy. I want breakfast!"

I continue looking out the window for another minute, then warily let my eyes drift from the windowsill.

***

The sizzle of eggs in the pan seems to invigorate Meya, and throughout the rest of breakfast she rambled on continuously about spontaneous topics, leaving me no time to ponder the appearance of the stranger. It took the arrival of my mum and a stern "Meya, be quiet" to finally convince her to give me some time.

Who was the stranger? Was he real or a figment of my lonely imagination? And if he was real, why was he here?

Of course, this wasn't reason to be concerned yet. No, the Council wouldn't be hearing about the new stranger in Newbor until I was one hundred percent sure he was real.

***

The rest of the day was nothing out of the ordinary. Most of it was spent under Mr Harvord's care, which meant the usual - sitting around in a classroom all day, doing nothing much. Mr Harvord was a stern old man who very much valued 'education' and prided himself on being able to teach it as well as he did, even if nobody ever listened. After all, we were never going to need to know algebra or how to spell 'pronunciation' or how to say 'hi, how are you' in French here in Newbor, full stop. Most of his classes were him up at the blackboard scribbling some formula or another while the ten or so older kids sat as far away as possible, messing around, killing time, and thinking of mischievous things to annoy the old timer.

After school, nothing much had changed either. Meya was, as usual, playing with the other kids in the field, laughing and running round like there wasn't a care in the world. It was always easy to find My, with the kids' voices being carried across the town by the wind, magnified for all of us to hear. The hard part was usually getting her to leave, and her attitude towards me today was nothing out of the ordinary; it involved fingers in ears, pretend ignorance, and a lot of running away. The other teens had the same problem with their siblings, too. And every time the kids dragged out their games until the Sun was out of the horizon, and the orange tint of the sky had faded to a rich, beautiful black -

_What was that?_

A shadow darts across the field, leaving behind the rustle of grass as it moves.

_Could it be?_

The shadow stops, turns, and surveys the town, its pupils glowing a magnificent yellow. They slowly move as he tracks his head, looking at the village, before they -

_Was he looking at me?_

His eyes, and their beautiful gold pupils, lock onto mine. Again, they open wide in surprise, but now there's another emotion there. Recognition.

The blink of an eye later, the gold colour of his pupils can only be seen in the millions of stars hanging above me.

_Who is he?_

There are no strangers in Newbor.

But nor are there any yellow eyes.



## Chapter 3

That night, we didn't go down to the indent in the cliff with the campfire which cracked and spluttered.

That night, I was not in the mood for a story.

That night, I sat planted in front of the window, 'stargazing', hoping for the boy with the gold eyes to reappear. He didn't look dangerous, or harmful. Instead, he looked lost. Like a boy searching for a home.

Maybe that's why I didn't tell the Council.

Or maybe it was because this boy with the gold eyes fascinated me, with his mysterious and stealthy ways. After all, he wasn't going to hurt anyone... was he?

_Was he?_

***

That was the night when everything started going wrong.

The night when a child disappeared, snatched from their beds quietly and bloodlessly.

The night which would remain as one of the most horrifying and frightening nights to have ever occurred in the peaceful, safe, uneventful town of Newbor, a town with no strangers.

***

That morning I woke to a barrage of noise coming from outside the window. The usual quiet fields and paths of Newbor were, instead, filled with shouting and fast, panicked discussion. As I tried to lie in my quilt, blocking out the noise, I couldn't help overhearing the conversation outside.

"Disappeared... missing... no trace... right from her house... poor girl... name is Amber..."

I jolt up with such startling pace that I bang my head, and quickly run to my window looking for traces of the boy. A million thoughts race through my head. _The disappearance of the girl and the appearance of the boy with gold eyes must be a coincidence. Otherwise how could anything happen? Who could have kidnapped poor Amber? What has the boy done to her? Why didn't I tell anybody?_

On my way to the kitchen I run into Meya, whose eyes are wide, mournful, and full of fear. I half-heartedly reassure her that everything will be alright, still feeling uneasy and a little queasy, but she seems to accept what I say and goes back to her room looking somewhat less pale.

_The goddamn boy. Why did you think that he could have been up to anything good?_

Mum, carrying the untouched remains of My's breakfast, is in the kitchen, trying to tidy up. I sit down and grab a plate, realizing that today she decided to fry the bacon, and try to gulf some down. She tries to encourage me to go to 'school' with old Mr Harvord but only seems to be doing so to half-reassure herself, and doesn't protest when I politely refuse, either out of tiredness or because she is preoccupied with finding lil' Amber.

You see, as one of the most intelligent women in the village the council had appointed my mum with the role of "Consul", ironic as she had lived her whole life in Newbor. Her job was to lead investigations whenever anything went awry, which usually consisted of quizzing the local children until _someone_ owned up to a robbery. But today, even _her_ usual cool and calm demeanor had given way to face full of panic, fear, and worry.

Outside the house was no better. The Council of Elders were deep in discussion with Mr and Mrs Connor, no doubt to try to reassure them. Lovely people, from what I know - Mr Connor was an engineer and was in charge of making sure the houses built in the town were safe as well as a generous donator of lollies to the children, while Mrs Connor was the local scribe who wrote all the important documents.

The adults were also occupied talking to each other, their voices weaving over and under each other to form a chorus of sound which hit me like a wall. Occasionally I caught snippets of conversation - "She must be hiding... Who could have done it... I'm sure it's just a prank... Amber, Amber, where are you?"

_God… where is he? We need to have a word. A stern one._

## Chapter 4

An hour.

That's how long I'd been running, hunting the mysterious boy with the golden eyes.

And yet he still was not anywhere to be seen.

_Where could he have gone?_

_The village is surrounded by miles and miles of flat, hill-less field… he either must have hiked very far or… disappeared. Into thin air._

My subconscious seemed to be speaking to me. Making rational thought for me. Stress does that to people, I guess.

_Come on, Saph. He couldn't have just vanished into thin air._

_Or could he?_

---

## Chapter 5

That afternoon there was no playing in the fields. No sitting and watching the beautiful sunset fade the sky to a red. And that afternoon, there were no golden eyes and mysterious boys in the field.

_He's here, somewhere. You just gotta find him._

Of course. I've got to find him.

_And punish him._

And punish him, for kidnapping poor Amber.

_God knows what's being done to her._

God knows. We can only hope for the -

_Look!_

Look? At what?

_LOOK!_

There's nothing - just the usual moonlight and gold ey-

Gold eyes?

_It's him! Get him!_

Quickly, I make a mental map of where the boy is and sprint down the stairs, past terrified Mother, and out the door.

_Almost there!_

Yes! Almost there, subconscious! Look! That's where he was sitting… except there's nobody there...

Scouting yields no results of his location. Apart from the indent in the wheat where he has been gazing at me, there is no mark of impact or damage - just untouched wheat.

My subconscious snarls as effectively as a voice in your head can snarl, and almost spits.

_Stupid boy! I knew that he would do…_

Do what?

The silence from my subconscious folds over me and quickly I feel my isolation. I'm in field, half a mile from home, completely alone, with a stalker in the vicinity. 

"Pssst!" A voice rings out in the darkness, not mine, piercing my ears. "Is that voice gone?"

Terrified, I reach out to hold something - and feel my hand clasping warm flesh.

A rose blush emerges on my face, thankfully hidden by the darkness of the night, as a pair of golden eyes look down into mine.

I manage to shriek out a "get away from me!" before my tiredness finally closes my eyelids and bades me goodnight.
