# Dancing in the Dark

## Chapter 1
The fire splutters as I fan my hand over the coals with an audible crack, its last breath.

A small voice behind me desperately cries, "No, the story wasn't finished!" as I am snapped out of my trance-like storytelling state by the sudden onset of black.

Everything seems different at night. More... sharp. The complicated colours of the daytime are converted into monotones of varying look - some soft, some harsh, but never out-of-place, and the light blue of the day sky morphs into a beautiful display of lights, contrasting beautifully on a dark background.

I've heard stories about the city children - everyone here in Newbor has. I've heard stories about children who have left their houses in the darkness and never returned. I've heard millions of stories about the dangers of the darkness. About how there are a million and one different things which can happen to you if you're outside during the dark. We all have. But we all also know that there is no need to be afraid of the dark in Newbor, where the only strangers are the occasional traveling merchants who visit us once or twice every Solstice, and even then they only stay during the daytime. At night, we have the 50-odd residents of Newbor to protect us, and because of that we need not fear the darkness.

"Please, don't go. I wanna hear another story," Meya pleads, pulling on my arm as if she never wants to let me go. Outwardly, I sigh, while little My lets out an exuberant sigh of relief, relaxing her iron grip on my arm. Slowly, I turn towards her, looking at her sternly in the dim moonlight.

"Fine, but _one more_ story. A short one, too."

She contently slumps down in her bed as I jump under the warm covers, and prepare my richest storytelling voice.

"They say that Newbor is haunted sometimes, by the plague of a devil long gone. A devil so devilish that whatever it touched would turn to ash, so devilish that it could wipe out fields of crops with a single word, so devilish that it could summon a tempest with purely the power of its mind."

Meya shudders with something - either fear of excitement, I can't tell which - before settling back down, to let me finish.

"You see, long ago there was an Alchemist in Newbor, a man who could summon up mythical creatures with just the power of his mind and a few spells. One day the Alchemist got bored with conjuring toads and frogs to entertain the town" - there was a stifle of a laugh from My - "and decided to test his power, to see just what he _could_ summon. So, he flipped open his book, and saw that the previous owner of the book had slipped in a piece of paper with a spell on it."

"Now, being the curious fellow he was this Alchemist was excited to make sense of this spell, so he tried to decipher it to see what it did. And yet, nobody knew exactly what the incantations were, and what they would do. The potions were completely new mixtures, seemingly frivolous but upon closer look rather complex and ingenious. The ingredients were exotic and mysteriously new. The brewing methods were nothing short of difficult. And the Alchemist, sensing a challenge in the spell, decided to undertake it as his new project."

"So, he traveled far and wide in search for the ingredients to make the potions. He asked both the knowledgeable and the experienced Wizards of the world to try to decipher the incantations. He relentlessly researched the potion ingredients, and painstakingly collected a pantry of the materials he would need to complete this spell."

"But, you see, there was a simple reason nobody understood what the spell did - because it wasn't a spell from the mortal realm. Uduootu, from the Cthulhu demon land, had possessed a child in Newbor to slip a sheet of paper into the Alchemist's spell tome, to summon him into the Humans' world. And, like Uduootu had planned, when the spell was summoned, the demon was transported into Newbor, right beside the Alchemist."

"Yet there was a problem. Uduootu had been forced to use a weak, humane spell, which severely limited his power and range to only a fraction of his full capacity, and therefore was not only bound to Newbor, but also incapable of hurting any adults in the town."

"So, Uduootu fed his thirst for blood with the poor children of the town. It wasn't long before Uduootu had snatched the Newbor children from their mothers and sentenced them to eternal hell within Cthulhu, the worst form of hell."

Meya gasps, a piercing shriek which stands out against my sonorous reading voice in the silence.
