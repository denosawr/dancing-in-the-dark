dancing in the dark - a story

> Any visitor to the town of Newbor, home to fifty residents, will describe it using the same select words.
> 
> Safe. Peaceful. Calm.
> So when the disappearance of a young girl coincides with the sudden appearance of an unknown boy in town, all suspicion instantly falls on the boy.
> 
> But Leila's gut tells her that the boy is innocent.
> And her gut instincts are usually right.
